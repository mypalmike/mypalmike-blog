One of my college professors, Beverly Woolf, hired me as a subcontractor to help develop a prototype for a 3D training simulator. The training was called MOUT, or Military Operations in Urban Terrain, and focused on things like how a squad should enter and clear a room, where they should be looking, etc. This was a 6 month contract, and we delivered the system on time.
